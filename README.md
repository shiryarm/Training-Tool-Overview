This interactive, scenario-based game is designed to teach players how to recognize and respond to common social engineering attacks—such as phishing, impersonation, and baiting—through real-life workplace situations.

Players take on the role of an employee working at a fictional company. Throughout the game, they must make decisions in response to suspicious messages, phone calls, virtual meetings, or unexpected deliveries. Each choice leads to different outcomes, simulating the real consequences of secure vs. insecure actions. The game provides immediate feedback and explanations to reinforce learning.
